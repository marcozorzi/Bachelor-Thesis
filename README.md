# Bachelor Thesis Reading Instruction
You can find the Matlab simulation files in the mat folder. Please apologize the half-english, half-italian comments and variable naming.
The final file to check is the one called BLDCM.m
Please make sure to also read the README in the mat folder for clarification and, for a deeper understanding of the work, please find the bachelor thesis report here attached "TesiMZ.pdf".

# Implementation
After the Bachelor thesis was presented, I kept on going to actually implement it. You can find a video of the working version at this link:

You can read a report of the tests performed in the "report frizione 2015.pdf" file: unfortunately this is in italian only, as it was a document I developed for the team in order to transfer knowledge to my future teammates and allow them to learn from my experience. For this reason, Italian was the easiest language for them.
