NOTE: these simulation contain a partially incorrect assumption, which is the way the current was estimated from the load torque. That calculation was made with the usual static current behaviour, assumption that does not properly hold given the transient behaviour of the application. Nevertheless the system proved to be effective, even though a bit slower than the original requirements.
